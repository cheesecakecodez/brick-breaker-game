# Brick Breaker Game (Java)

A Brick Breaker game developed in **Java using Eclipse**, created as a learning-focused project to understand and implement **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts through practical application.

The emphasis of this project is on **discipline, structure, and learning through implementation**.

---

## Project Intent

This project was built to:
- Strengthen core Java fundamentals
- Apply OOP concepts in a real, working program
- Understand interaction between multiple classes
- Improve logical thinking and debugging skills

---

## Object-Oriented Concepts Applied

- **Encapsulation**  
  Game data and behavior are confined within clearly defined classes.

- **Inheritance**  
  Shared properties and logic are reused through parent–child class relationships.

- **Polymorphism**  
  Method overriding enables different behaviors for related objects.

- **Abstraction (introductory level)**  
  Focus on *what* an object does rather than *how* it does it.

---

## Features

- Keyboard-controlled paddle movement
- Ball movement and collision detection
- Brick destruction logic
- Score tracking
- Game over and restart handling

---

## Technology Used

- Language: Java  
- IDE: Eclipse  
- GUI: Java Swing / AWT  

---

## How to Run

1. Open **Eclipse**
2. Import the project as an **Existing Project into Workspace**
3. Run the **main game class**

---

## What This Project Teaches

- Practical application of Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Event handling and keyboard input management
- Game state management and flow control
- Code organization and separation of responsibilities
- Debugging through iterative development

---

## Future Work

- Improved collision accuracy
- Multiple levels and difficulty progression
- Performance optimizations
- Cleaner separation of game logic and rendering
